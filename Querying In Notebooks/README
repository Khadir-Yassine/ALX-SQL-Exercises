# 📘 Querying In Notebooks

🖙 [Back to main repository](../README.md)

This folder contains notebooks and exercises that focus on the basics of SQL querying using Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🗘️ Learning Path in this Chapter

1. SELECT and WHERE
2. Logical and Comparison Operators
3. Reading Data Across Multiple Tables
4. Exercises and Practice

## 🧠 Topics Covered

* `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses
* Logical and comparison operators (`AND`, `OR`, `>`, `<`, `=`)
* Commenting and aliasing in SQL
* Reading from multiple tables

## ✅ What I Learned

* Writing clean SQL queries using SELECT and WHERE
* Applying logical operators to filter data
* Using comments and aliases to enhance readability
* Exploring data stored in multiple tables
