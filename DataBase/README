| [`Data dictionary.pdf`](./Data%20dictionary.pdf)   | Documentation that describes the database tables, columns, and data types                |
| [`md_water_services.sql`](./md_water_services.sql) | SQL script to create and populate the `md_water_services` database used in all exercises |

## 🧠 Purpose

These resources are essential for running the SQL notebooks smoothly. Make sure to:

1. Read the **Data Dictionary** to understand the structure of the data.
2. Run the SQL script in your MySQL or SQLite environment to create the database before starting exercises.

## ⚙️ How to Use

* Open your MySQL client or Jupyter Notebook with a SQL kernel.
* Execute the content of `md_water_services.sql` to create and populate the database.
* Refer to `Data dictionary.pdf` while writing or debugging your queries.

> 💡 Tip: You can re-run the `.sql` file anytime you want to reset the database to its original state.
